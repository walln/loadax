"""The dataloader is a primitive for efficiently loading data from a dataset.

For the most part, just using the DataLoader fluent builder is all you should need.
However, if full customization is needed, the specific dataloader can be used directly
by importing one of the following:

- NaiveDataLoader: The naive dataloader is a simple dataloader that loads data in a
  single thread. It is not recommended to use this dataloader directly, but it can
  be useful for debugging or for simple use cases.
- DistributedDataLoader: The distributed dataloader is a dataloader that leverages
  concurrent futures to load data in parallel for a single node and can be combined
  with a Mesh and PartitionSpec to load data across multiple nodes, intelligently
  sharding the data across the nodes.
