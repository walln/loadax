# Roadmap

Loadax is a work in progress, and there are many features that are planned for the future. The current focus is on building a quality set of integrations with common dataset formats such as HuggingFace, Polars, and SQLite.

Here is a list of planned features:

- Support for more dataset formats
- Variable batching
- Throughput monitoring
- Better integration with the JAX profiling tools
- Utilities for working with TPUs

If you have any ideas for new features, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
